## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Automatic Host Upgrade System
1. **User Registration**: Users start with role "user" and isHost: false
2. **Vehicle Addition**: When users add vehicles through the simple add vehicle section
3. **Automatic Upgrade**: System automatically upgrades user to "host" status
4. **Data Tracking**: Host since date, role change, and vehicle ownership linking

### User ID Integration
1. **Transaction Tracking**: All transactions include proper userId from logged-in users
2. **Vehicle Ownership**: Vehicles are linked to their creators via userId
3. **Booking System**: Bookings include both customer and vehicle owner userIds
4. **Payment Integration**: eSewa payments include user identification

### Host Management System
1. **Host Dashboard**: Comprehensive interface for hosts to manage vehicles
2. **Statistics Tracking**: Vehicle count, active status, and view statistics
3. **Vehicle Management**: Edit, delete, and view vehicle functionality
4. **Revenue Potential**: Calculated based on active vehicles and pricing

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### User Model
```javascript
{
  role: { type: String, enum: ['user', 'host', 'admin'], default: 'user' },
  isHost: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  hostSince: { type: Date, default: null },
  vehiclesOwned: [{ type: ObjectId, ref: 'Vehicle' }]
}
```

### Transaction Model
```javascript
{
  vehicleData: {
    vehicleId: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'Vehicle', required: true },
    // ... other vehicle details
  },
  userId: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'User', default: null }
}
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Host Upgrade Flow
1. User logs in → userId stored in localStorage
2. User adds vehicle → userId sent with form data
3. Backend creates vehicle → checks user status
4. If not host → automatic upgrade to host
5. Vehicle linked to user → user.vehiclesOwned updated

### Transaction Flow with User ID
1. User selects vehicle → proceeds to payment
2. Payment page → userId from localStorage added to userInfo
3. eSewa payment → transaction created with userId
4. Payment success → booking automatically created
5. Both transaction and booking → linked to user via userId

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Host Functionality Test
```
✅ Test user created: john.host@example.com
   Initial Role: user
   Initial Host Status: false
