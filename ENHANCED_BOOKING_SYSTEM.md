# Enhanced Booking System & ProfileSidebar Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the booking system and ProfileSidebar component to enhance transaction data storage and mobile responsiveness.

## 1. Enhanced Booking Model

### New Transaction Data Fields
The Booking model has been enhanced with comprehensive transaction data storage:

```javascript
transactionData: {
  // Original transaction amount and currency
  originalAmount: Number,
  currency: String (default: 'NPR'),
  
  // Gateway specific data
  gatewayResponse: Mixed, // Stores complete gateway response
  
  // Processing details
  processingFee: Number,
  
  // Payment gateway information
  gateway: String, // 'esewa', 'stripe', 'paypal', 'razorpay', 'khalti'
  
  // Transaction timestamps
  initiatedAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date,
  
  // Failure information
  failureReason: String,
  
  // Refund information
  refundData: {
    refundId: String,
    refundAmount: Number,
    refundDate: Date,
    refundReason: String,
    refundStatus: String // 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'
  }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Complete Transaction Tracking**: Store full payment gateway responses
- **Audit Trail**: Track transaction initiation and completion times
- **Refund Management**: Built-in refund tracking and status management
- **Multi-Gateway Support**: Support for multiple payment gateways
- **Failure Analysis**: Store and analyze payment failure reasons

### Usage Example
```javascript
const booking = new Booking({
  // ... existing booking fields
  transactionData: {
    originalAmount: 5850,
    currency: 'NPR',
    gatewayResponse: {
      status: 'success',
      gateway_transaction_id: 'GTX123456',
      response_code: '000'
    },
    processingFee: 100,
    gateway: 'esewa',
    initiatedAt: new Date(),
    completedAt: new Date()
  }
});
```

## 2. ProfileSidebar Fixes & Improvements
